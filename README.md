# FoodCraft - 3D Food Printing Application

FoodCraft is an innovative application developed by students from IIT Mandi. It allows users to print food items using a 3D printer and is designed to integrate with upcoming 3D food printers that are currently in development. The printed food will be edible and can be produced in real-time.

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **Flutter**: A framework for building native applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for developing Flutter applications.
- **Firestore**: A flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase.
- **OctoPrint API**: An API for controlling and monitoring 3D printers, which is utilized for managing the printing process.
